# Hierarchical Poll System

## Requirements

Create a new vote type called "Polling Vote" that extends the existing voting system.

### Core Features
1. **Vote Type**: Add "Polling Vote" as a new vote type
2. **Question Structure**: Convert existing "named choices" to "Questions" with sub-answers
3. **Hierarchical Design**: Support unlimited questions and sub-answers at each level
4. **Answer Types**: Each question/sub-question can be configured as:
   - Single choice
   - Multiple choice  
   - Ordering/ranking
5. **Results Display**: Present results per question after poll completion

### 4. Example Use Case

```
Poll: "Product Feedback"
├─ Q1: "Do you use our mobile app?"
│  ├─ A1: "Yes" → 
│  │  └─ Q1.1: "Which features do you use most?"
│  │     ├─ A1.1: "Messaging"
│  │     ├─ A1.2: "Calendar"
│  │     └─ A1.3: "File sharing"
│  └─ A2: "No" →
│     └─ Q1.2: "What prevents you from using our mobile app?"
│        ├─ A2.1: "Don't have a smartphone"
│        ├─ A2.2: "Prefer desktop version"
│        └─ A2.3: "Didn't know it existed"
└─ Q2: "How often do you use our service?"
   ├─ A3: "Daily"
   ├─ A4: "Weekly"
   └─ A5: "Monthly"
```

### Technical Requirements

1. Extend existing voting system with "Polling Vote" type

3. Support unlimited nesting levels (questions → answers → sub-questions → sub-answers)
4. Configure answer types per question (single choice, multiple choice, or ordering)
5. Save response paths with parent-child relationships
6. Generate results showing answer distribution for each question
