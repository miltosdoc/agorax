I want to redesign the AgoraX digital democracy platform with a modern, professional aesthetic while preserving all existing functionality. Please approach this as a comprehensive UI/UX refresh following these principles:

CORE OBJECTIVES:
- Maintain 100% of current features and functionality
- Create a clean, modern, and professional visual design
- Prioritize mobile-first design and exceptional mobile experience
- Improve user experience and interface usability across all devices
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness and accessibility
- Keep the robust architecture intact

DESIGN APPROACH:
- Use contemporary design patterns (consider subtle animations, better spacing, modern color schemes)
- Improve visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Enhance the Greek civic/democracy theme with professional design elements
- Modernize component styling while maintaining consistency
- Refine interactions and micro-interactions for better UX
- Design touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate tap targets (minimum 44px)
- Optimize for thumb-zone navigation on mobile devices

MOBILE COMPATIBILITY PRIORITIES:
- **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile screens first, then scale up
- Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable on touchscreens
- Optimize the Leaflet map interface for mobile gestures and smaller screens
- Make the TipTap editor fully functional on mobile devices
- Ensure forms are easy to fill out on mobile (proper input types, spacing, validation)
- Test poll creation, voting, and results viewing on mobile
- Optimize navigation for small screens (hamburger menu, bottom nav, or other mobile patterns)
- Ensure images and charts scale properly on all screen sizes
- Consider swipe gestures and mobile-specific interactions where appropriate
- Optimize performance for mobile networks and devices

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change the underlying architecture or core logic
- Preserve all existing routes, API endpoints, and database schemas
- Maintain compatibility with current tech stack (React, Tailwind, Radix UI, etc.)
- Keep authentication, geofencing, and voting systems unchanged
- Update only UI components and styling layers
- Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints effectively (sm, md, lg, xl)

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Focus on CSS/Tailwind updates and component refinement
- Improve visual consistency across all pages and screen sizes
- Enhance the TipTap editor experience on both desktop and mobile
- Modernize the Leaflet map interface with mobile-optimized controls
- Refine form inputs, buttons, and interactive elements for touch
- Update the poll creation and voting interfaces with mobile UX in mind
- Improve the dashboard and results visualization for small screens
- Ensure proper text sizing (minimum 16px for body text to prevent zoom on iOS)
- Test all interactive components on various mobile screen sizes
- If translations are needed for updated UI text, provide them in both Greek and English

PRIORITIES:
1. Exceptional mobile user experience (majority of users will be on mobile)
2. Professional, trustworthy appearance suitable for civic engagement
3. Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation on all devices
4. Smooth, responsive interactions optimized for touch
5. Modern but not trendy (timeless design)
6. Accessibility and performance on mobile devices

RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS TO CONSIDER:
- Mobile: 320px - 640px (primary focus)
- Tablet: 641px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px+

Please provide a systematic redesign plan, then implement changes incrementally, starting with the most impactful visual and mobile improvements. Test each component on mobile viewports. Maintain robustness and avoid over-complication.
