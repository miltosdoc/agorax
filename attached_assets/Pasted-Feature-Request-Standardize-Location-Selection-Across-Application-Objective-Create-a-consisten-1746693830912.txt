Feature Request: Standardize Location Selection Across Application

Objective:
Create a consistent location selection system using a predefined location list across all application components (profile settings, poll creation, vote modal, and location filters).

Key Requirements:
1. Use the SAME predefined location list in:
   - User profile location (manual input)
   - Poll creation form
   - Vote modal
   - Location filters

2. Location Matching Logic:
   - Do NOT match using GPS coordinates EXCEPT for geofencing votes
   - For geofencing votes ONLY, continue to use GPS coordinates as currently implemented
   - For all other location matching, use exact text comparison from the predefined list
   - Ensure consistency between poll-form, vote-modal, and user profile location

3. User Experience:
   - If a user has set their location via GPS but tries to create a poll:
     → Show a message prompting them to update their location using the predefined list
   - If a user has set their location from the predefined list but tries to use GPS:
     → Show a message explaining the need to use the predefined list

4. Dropdown Functionality:
   - CRITICAL: Maintain current dropdown list functionality
   - Users MUST be able to select country, region, city, etc. from dropdown lists exactly as they do now
   - Any changes to the selection mechanism will NOT be accepted

5. Poll Form Default State:
   - The poll form MUST NOT have any preselected values for:
     → City
     → Region
     → Country
   - All location fields must start empty/unselected

6. Database & Validation (CRITICAL):
   - FOCUS on consistent database storage of:
     → User location
     → Vote location restrictions
   - Store locations in a standardized format using values from the predefined list
   - Implement robust validation to identify location mismatches
   - Prevent unauthorized users from casting votes when their location doesn't match poll requirements
   - Validation must occur server-side to ensure security

7. Constraints:
   - Do NOT modify existing Geofencing settings
   - Geofencing votes should continue to use GPS coordinates as currently implemented

Technical Implementation Notes:
- The predefined location list should be stored in a single place and referenced by all components
- Validation should occur on form submission AND server-side before accepting votes
- User-friendly error messages should clearly explain the required action
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing dropdown UI components
- Database schema should support efficient location-based queries and validation
- Maintain separate logic paths for geofencing vs. predefined-list location validation
